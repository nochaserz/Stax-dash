ðŸ‘‰ Next step: I can also generate a **GitHub repo structure** (folders + boilerplate files) so you can upload and launch STAXâ€™s first public version.  

Do you want me to draft that repo structure too (like `/src`, `/docs`, `/config`, README, LICENSE, etc.) so you have the scaffolding ready to push?
